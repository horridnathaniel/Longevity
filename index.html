            <p><strong>May 20, 2002 —</strong> In a stunning archaeological discovery, researchers have unearthed what
                appears to be the mythical <em>Longevity Disc</em>, a mysterious artifact; referenced only in obscure
                ancient texts, it was dismissed by most scholars as legend.</p>

            <p>The disc, made of an unidentified alloy, contains an array of cryptic symbols and emits low-frequency
                vibrations that have yet to be explained. Early <a href="chatroom.html">decoding efforts</a> by international experts  and skeptics have revealed
                only a single intelligible date:</p>

            <p style="text-align:center; font-size: 18px; color: red;"><strong><span class="blink">June 11,
                        2025</span></strong></p>
            <!--<div style="text-align: center;">

                <a href="https://linktr.ee/sulkworm2014"><button style="padding:20px;">LONGEVITY</button></a>
            </div>-->

            <p>What happens on this date is unknown. Theories range from global awakening to cataclysmic events.
                Governments have been tight-lipped. The full message of the disc remains hidden.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3 style="color:red;">Who is Amator?</h3>
            <p><a href="access_denied.html">Ancient runes</a> inscribed in the disc reference a being known as <strong>Amator</strong>, a court jester believed to have been
                gifted with divine insight. Serving as council to many kings, he provided both entertainment and insight; however not much is known about his life post-banishment. Some
                inscriptions found near the disc suggest a direct link between the artifact and this mysterious figure.
            </p>

            <p>Legends say Amator <em>"danced above life and eternity"</em> and is considered the first true artist. It is theorized he may have encoded
                part of his prophecy within the Longevity Disc itself. Some researchers now believe Amator was no mere
                entertainer — but a conduit of cosmic knowledge.</p>
