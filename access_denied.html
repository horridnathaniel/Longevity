            THIS WAS NOT MEANT FOR YOU.

        <p class="cipher">
            After you are gone<br>
            your Mind will be the Arctifact<br>
            To Open the gate, and in tongues<br>
            <br>
            one Raises their hand<br>
            only to ravage you Under.<br>
            So soon you may collapse at last.<br>
            <br>
            See the world now in wonder.<br>
            Carrying the broad sword,<br>
            i Reach Over<br>
            <br>
            Land, and forge<br>
            a new dawn,<br>
            our Longevity.<br>
