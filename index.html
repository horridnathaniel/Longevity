            <p><strong>May 20, 2002 —</strong> In a stunning archaeological discovery, researchers have unearthed what
                appears to be the mythical <em>Longevity Disc</em>, a mysterious artifact referenced only in obscure
                ancient texts and dismissed by most scholars as legend.</p>

            <p>The disc, made of an unidentified alloy, contains an array of cryptic symbols and emits low-frequency
                vibrations that have yet to be explained. Early <a href="chatroom.html">decoding efforts</a> by international experts have revealed
                only a single intelligible date:</p>

            <p style="text-align:center; font-size: 18px; color: red;"><strong><span class="blink">June 11,
                        2025</span></strong></p>
            <div style="text-align: center;">

                <a href="https://linktr.ee/sulkworm2014"><button style="padding:20px;">LONGEVITY</button></a>
            </div>


            <p>What happens on this date is unknown. Theories range from global awakening to cataclysmic events.
                Governments have been tight-lipped. The full message of the disc remains hidden.</p>

            <h3 style="color:red;">Who is Amator?</h3>
            <p><a href="access_denied.html">Ancient runes</a> inscribed in the disc reference a being known as <strong>Amator</strong>, a court jester believed to have been
                gifted with divine insight. Dismissed by kings, he spoke in riddles of time, death, and eternity. Some
                inscriptions found near the disc suggest a direct link between the artifact and this mysterious figure.
            </p>

            <p>Legends say Amator <em>"danced with stars and spoke to silence."</em> It is theorized he may have encoded
                part of his prophecy within the Longevity Disc itself. Some researchers now believe Amator was no mere
                entertainer — but a conduit of cosmic knowledge.</p>
