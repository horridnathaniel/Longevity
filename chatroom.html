            <p><span class="timestamp">[20:31]</span> <span class="username">InfernalScholar:</span> Mapped the disc’s layers to
                Dante’s nine circles. The geometry matches. This isn’t random.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[20:32]</span> <span class="username">CasualFog:</span> wait what disc? like a CD? i just
                clicked the link from Twitter lol</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[20:32]</span> <span class="username">DataScorn:</span> oh god, here we go again. Not
                every spiral is a symbol. Some of y’all need daylight.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[20:33]</span> <span class="username">NeoGlyph:</span> The glyphs are cyclical. Each ring
                could be a prophecy. You just have to listen.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[20:34]</span> <span class="username">ScrollWatcher:</span> The Cyclops Amator faced is
                clearly symbolic of the Inferno’s Minotaur — a test of wrath and reason.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[20:35]</span> <span class="username">Visitor9:</span> are we talking about the guy with
                the jester mask?? where do i read the story?</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[20:35]</span> <span class="username">NullFate:</span> Yeah, read it, and it sounds like
                bad fanfiction. A frog turns into a prophet? C’mon.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[20:36]</span> <span class="username">LadyOfRuins:</span> Mock all you want, but the cave
                is real. Same location marked in 13th century Vatican maps. Proven.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[20:38]</span> <span class="username">BurningInk:</span> Amator’s sacrifice mirrors
                Christ’s descent into Sheol. It’s the same myth pattern retold.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[20:39]</span> <span class="username">EchoingVoid:</span> You all seriously need a hobby.
                This is a marketing campaign. Chill.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[20:41]</span> <span class="username">DreamNode:</span> What if June 11 isn’t the end…
                but a portal opening? The “countdown” is an invitation.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[20:42]</span> <span class="username">SoftSleeper:</span> this is super weird but kinda
                cool ngl. is there like a summary somewhere?</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[20:43]</span> <span class="username">DiscWatcher:</span> The disc vibrates when left on
                stone overnight. This isn’t digital. This is old.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[20:45]</span> <span class="username">EncryptedJester:</span> Amator wasn’t a fool. He
                was chosen because laughter confuses demons. The jest is divine.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[20:46]</span> <span class="username">BrassCube:</span> No joke, if demons are afraid of
                memes, we’re already saved.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[20:47]</span> <span class="username">AncientSeeker42:</span> The countdown syncs with
                solar alignments tied to Revelation’s Beast cycle. I’ve seen the math.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[20:48]</span> <span class="username">CasualFog:</span> what’s Revelation?? is this like
                Bible stuff??</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[20:49]</span> <span class="username">ZeroOne:</span> Revelation? Now we’re just grabbing
                random books and making up patterns. Wild how deep denial runs.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[20:50]</span> <span class="username">NeoGlyph:</span> You only call it denial because it
                doesn’t fit your safe, limited lens. Wake up.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[20:51]</span> <span class="username">Visitor9:</span> this is insane... where do i sign
                up for updates lol</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[20:52]</span> <span class="username">ProphetPattern:</span> Daniel spoke of visions
                sealed until the time of the end. The disc might be the unsealing.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[20:53]</span> <span class="username">BurningInk:</span> Rev. 10:4 — “Seal up those
                things which the seven thunders uttered.” That’s the disc. That’s why it hums.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[20:54]</span> <span class="username">NeoGlyph:</span> Daniel 2’s statue. Gold, silver,
                bronze... The disc’s layers match that succession. Prophetic metallurgy.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[20:55]</span> <span class="username">ScrollWatcher:</span> “The wise will understand.”
                That’s Daniel 12. The countdown is making more sense now.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[20:56]</span> <span class="username">CasualFog:</span> i found a .txt file in the page
                source. is that part of the game??</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[20:57]</span> <span class="username">ScrollWatcher:</span> That file is a cipher.
                Reverse-ASCII layered with Latin abbreviations. Definitely intentional.</p>
        
            <!-- Time jump -->
            <p><span class="timestamp">[21:34]</span> <span class="username">NullFate:</span> ok ngl i started dreaming about
                the cave last night. and i’ve never read the story. what is going on?</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[21:35]</span> <span class="username">InfernalScholar:</span> Welcome to the fold. Some
                say the disc induces resonance through exposure. It remembers.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[21:36]</span> <span class="username">ZeroOne:</span> whoa. my browser just froze when i
                tried opening the countdown page in Netscape. weird.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[21:37]</span> <span class="username">EncryptedJester:</span> Glitches are transmissions.
                The signal hides in the static. Listen carefully next time.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[21:39]</span> <span class="username">EchoingVoid:</span> okay no this is... this is
                starting to get under my skin.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[21:40]</span> <span class="username">LadyOfRuins:</span> You felt it too then. The disc
                reacts strongest before the solstice. Your time zone matters.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[21:42]</span> <span class="username">NullFate:</span> in the dream, something whispered
                “time, times, and half a time.” i googled it. Daniel again??</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[21:44]</span> <span class="username">ProphetPattern:</span> That phrase is from Daniel
                7. The disc is the vision. We just weren’t ready to see it until now.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[21:45]</span> <span class="username">AncientSeeker42:</span> The beast with ten horns...
                cross-ref with Ezekiel and Revelation. Amator’s Cyclops may be a cipher.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[21:46]</span> <span class="username">InfernalScholar:</span> The horns, the abyss, the
                sealed knowledge. It's all converging. Something's about to break open.</p>
