            <p><span class="timestamp">[20:03]</span> <span class="username">AncientSeeker42:</span> Anyone else feel
                like the date on the disc is a warning and not a prophecy?</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[20:05]</span> <span class="username">NeoGlyph:</span> I'm convinced Amator was
                extraterrestrial. The vibrational frequency of the disc isn‚Äôt human tech.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[20:07]</span> <span class="username">LadyOfRuins:</span> You all are missing the
                point. The *red eclipse* mentioned in the inscriptions is a historical omen.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[20:08]</span> <span class="username">QuantumHelix:</span> Just dropping this:
                ‚ÄúTime bends not for kings, but laughs for jesters.‚Äù It was etched faintly on the disc‚Äôs inner ring.
                Amator‚Äôs doing?</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[20:09]</span> <span class="username">DiscWatcher:</span> Something pulsed when
                the disc was exposed to moonlight. There's energy in it still.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[20:11]</span> <span class="username">ZeroOne:</span> The countdown ends on June
                11, 2025. That‚Äôs exactly 8,400 days since the turn of the millennium. Coincidence? Nope.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[20:13]</span> <span class="username">EncryptedJester:</span> üîê ‚ÄúHE WILL SPEAK
                AGAIN‚Äù ‚Äî I found that phrase in the source code of the main page. Hidden in HTML comments. Who put it
                there?</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[20:15]</span> <span class="username">DreamNode:</span> Does anyone have the full
                glyph set from the outer disc layer? I think there‚Äôs a <a style="color:white" href="amator.html">second date</a> hidden in the markings.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[20:17]</span> <span class="username">Visitor9:</span> Why is no one talking
                about the ruins in Tunisia where the disc was found? That site isn‚Äôt on *any* map.</p>
